When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-If I'm sharing my files with other people and all of us are commiting changes to them
-If I want to keep my files synced between different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository?
I caould be working on some experimental features in my local repository or I could use the remote repository to 
just have the latest functional version of my program

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks: similar to repository clones, difference is forks point to the original repository and they can only be done
in GitHub. I would use one if I want to copy someone else's repository to make my own changes but keeping a link to 
the original repository
clones: clones are copies of a repository, they don't point to the original version and usually they are made from 
GitHub to a local machine or only in a local machine. I can clone a repository if I want a local copy of a repository 
in GitHub
branches: branches happen inside a repository, they are basically a chain of commits. I can use one to work on 
different versions of a same progran or add experimental features to it 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
it allows me to see if I have local changes that I haven't send to my remote copy yet.
