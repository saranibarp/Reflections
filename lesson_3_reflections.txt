When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-If I'm sharing my files with other people and all of us are commiting changes to them
-If I want to keep my files synced between different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository?
I caould be working on some experimental features in my local repository or I could use the remote repository to 
just have the latest functional version of my program
