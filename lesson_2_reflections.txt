What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
a hidden git folder gets created in the chosen directory, this folder contains metadata
about the repository. I need to do it to be able to commit changes to my files and compare their
different versions. I need to add files to the repository first

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The working directory is the folder on my machine, it's linked to a repository. Not all files in a working directory are tracked
by a repository.
The repository keeps metadata about tracked files and the different commits we could do for those files
The staging area is a middle ground between the working directory and the repository, it's usefull in case I make a mistake and add
a file I don't want in my repository, I can delete it from the staging area but it will still exist in my working directory
